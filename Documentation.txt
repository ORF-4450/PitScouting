To Do:

10/4/22-Move right side elements such as text boxes to fit to the right side of screen.
	This will require them to be seperated from their parent objects, which will be an issue because they won't disappear with the parent object.
	We could set it up so they do with the current system, but it would be clunky and spaghetti-like.
	I propose we create a new script that will copy the 'visible' tag from an object, and 'paste' it into the object the script is attached to.


10/26/22-Add 'help' button to LeftSidebar in the main menu. Link it to the google doc (Documentation for scouters)

10/26/22-Add "far" and "near" to position select display to avoid confusion. Do not include these in animation

10/26/22-It may be feasible to procedurally generate dropdown, textbox, counter, and checkbox positions by reading
a text file from the server.
	Once implemented, most of a programmer's job would be to change this text file, and they wouldn't need to touch
	the UI. It would be seperated into different sections, one for each scouting menu; Pregame, Autonomous,
	Teleop, Endgame, and Strategy.

10/26/22-Add menu for pit scouting (Scouting outside of simply watching the game; talking to teams and taking pictures)
