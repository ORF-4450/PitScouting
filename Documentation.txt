To Do:

10/4/22-Move right side elements such as text boxes to fit to the right side of screen.
	This will require them to be seperated from their parent objects, which will be an issue because they won't disappear with the parent object.
	We could set it up so they do with the current system, but it would be clunky and spaghetti-like.
	I propose we create a new script that will copy the 'visible' tag from an object, and 'paste' it into the object the script is attached to.


10/26/22-Add 'help' button to LeftSidebar in the main menu. Link it to the google doc (Documentation for scouters)

10/26/22-Add "far" and "near" to position select display to avoid confusion. Do not include these in animation

10/26/22-It may be feasible to procedurally generate dropdown, textbox, counter, and checkbox positions by reading
a text file from the server.
	Once implemented, most of a programmer's job would be to change this text file, and they wouldn't need to touch
	the UI. It would be seperated into different sections, one for each scouting menu; Pregame, Autonomous,
	Teleop, Endgame, and Strategy.

10/26/22-Add menu for pit scouting (Scouting outside of simply watching the game; talking to teams and taking pictures)

DOCUMENTATION:

LeftSidebar - 10/26/22
The left sidebar is the light blue strip on the left side of the screen. It contains the version number,
navigation buttons, and sync button.

Sync Button - 10/26/22
The sync button triggers DataStorage to send data (Not pictures, yet) to a google form for data collection. It
also recives data on current and future competitions; Competition names, team numbers, and team names.

Keys - 10/26/22
Each piece of data requires a key. A key is the name that classifies the piece of data. For instance,
a string containing a scouter's name is assiged 'ScouterName'.

ScoutingPosition - 10/26/22
Old dropdown for setting scouting position, might break stuff if deleted. New version is called
'Pre_StartingPos' (Pre-Game Starting Position).

Pre_StartingPos - 10/26/22
This object is composed of seven buttons ('Photos' is not a child of the object). Half of it is the red team, the other half is blue. Buttons change a
variable in the Pre_StartingPos object when clicked. Buttons read that variable and will light up when it is
equal to the button's name. The six upper buttons will turn when 'Swap' is pressed, in case the team is on the
other side of the field.

Inital Menu - 10/26/22
Parent object of most things that appear in the main menu.

PeriodMenu - 10/26/22
Parent of navigation buttons in the scouter menus.

Swap - 10/26/22
Triggers animation 'ButtonPressed' on itself, and triggers function 'Flip' of 'FlipImageScript',
located within 'Pre_StartingPos'. This script then triggers either animation 'SelectionButtonSpinCW'
or its inverse, 'SelectionButtonSpinCCW'.

Version - 10/26/22
Text, derrived using 'DataOutput' drawing data with key 'Version' from 'DataStore'.
